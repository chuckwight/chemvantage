An Open Education Resource for General Chemistry
</div>

<div class='seg1'>
<br/><b>About us</b><br/><br/>
ChemVantage LLC was founded in 2010 to provide Open Education Resources for teaching and learning General Chemistry. 
The founder and chief software architect of ChemVantage is Chuck Wight, who has taught General Chemistry since 1984 
at the University of Utah, Weber State University and now Salisbury University.<br/><br/>

Chemistry is usually taught from a problem-solving approach, and students need lots of practice to build a solid 
foundation for solving scientific problems. We create web sites that provide immediate feedback so that students 
can learn problem-solving skills without having to wait for their assignments to be graded by a human instructor.
</div>

<div class='seg2'>
<br/><b>Learning versus testing</b><br/><br/>
Web sites with dynamic content like this one are best used as learning tools, not assessment or testing tools.  
For this reason, we have configured the software to allow students to submit proposed solutions to the problems as often 
as they want, in order to improve their scores. The objective is for students to use the feedback to correct their errors 
prior to the deadline for the assignment.
</div>

<div class='seg1'>
<br/><b>Assignments</b><br/><br/>
ChemVantage offers several different types of assignments:<ul>
<li>Placement Exam - provides an advising tool for each student entering General Chemistry</li>
<li>Video Lectures - supplement the textbook, especially for visual learners</li>
<li>Quizzes - ensure that students are prepared for class discussions and activities</li>
<li>Homework - teaches students to apply their knowledge to solving chemical problems</li>
<li>Practice Exams - help to prepare students to take your in-class exams</li>
</ul>
All of the assignments can be customized by the instructor by selecting the question items that are most 
appropriate for your students.<br/><br/>

<div id='pricing' class='seg2'>
<br/><b>ChemVantage Pricing</b><br/><br/>
Institutions using the ChemVantage General Chemistry Placement Exam can purchase exams at a cost of 
$1.00/student in bundles of 100. Send email to <a href='mailto:admin@chemvantage.org'>admin@chemvantage.org</a> 
to order these. Students can use ChemVantage completely free of charge. In the future we may offer students 
optional subscription services, such as enhanced access to the detailed solutions to example problems. 
The cost of this subscription will likely be less than $1/month.</div>

<div class='seg2'>
<br/><b>Instructors</b><br/><br/>
ChemVantage is a great resource for teachers and professors because it leverages your institution's learning management 
system (e.g., Canvas, Moodle, Blackboard, Desire2Learn or Sakai) using the LTI standard. This allows your LMS to handle 
all passwords, role assignments and security.  To connect your LMS to ChemVantage, please visit our 
<a href=/lti/registration target=_blank>LTI registration page</a>. After 
registration, instructors can customize quiz and homework assignments for their classes using the instructor tools in each 
assignment.<br/><br/>

<b>Teaching Assistants</b><br/><br/>
An instructor may assign any LMS user to be a teaching assistant. This role is recognized by ChemVantage. Teaching assistants 
may view solutions to homework exercises to provide guidance to students on some of the more challenging problems.
</div>

<br/><div class='seg1'>
<b>Authors</b><br/><br/>
Any instructor wishing to contribute question items for quiz or homework assignments may do this using the instructor 
tools accessible in the assignments. A ChemVantage editor will review and edit them before including it in the database.  
The copyrights to all question items at this site are owned entirely by <b>ChemVantage LLC</b>. The only way that we can 
keep costs low enough to offer free services to both students and instructors is to avoid paying royalties.  Therefore, 
we ask all contributors of ChemVantage question items to certify that all contributed items are original works, and 
that the author assigns the copyrights to ChemVantage LLC to be shared freely under the terms of a
