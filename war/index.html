An Open Education Resource for General Chemistry<br/><br/><br/>

<b>Let's face it. Chemistry is hard.</b><br/><br/>
But with commitment and lots of practice, almost anyone can master it. 
ChemVantage was founded in 2010 on the idea that the most effective learning takes place during repeated 
intermittent engagement with the subject material. By offering several kinds of online assignments, we help you challenge students to
<ul>
<li>prepare themselves in advance for class discussions</li>
<li>engage with in-class polls using their own phones or laptops (no clickers required)</li>
<li>apply their new knowledge to solving computer-graded homework problems and get immediate feedback</li>
<li>work in teams to promote collaborative learning and peer instruction</li>
</ul>
... all at about 1/10 the cost of our nearest competitor.<br/><br/>

ChemVantage is proud to partner with OpenStax, the largest provider of OER textbooks for General Chemistry. We provide tools 
that are aligned with the OpenStax <a href=https://openstax.org/details/books/chemistry-2e>Chemistry/2e</a> and 
<a href=https://openstax.org/details/books/chemistry-atoms-first-2e>Chemistry: Atoms First/2e</a> texts, including a new SmartText 
app that combines reading assignments with adaptive questions covering key concepts in each chapter. This ensures that your students are 
<b>reading</b> and <b>understanding</b> the content in a timely way.

Getting students into the right course at the right time is essential. The ChemVantage placement exam assesses
<ul>
<li>knowledge of basic chemistry</li>
<li>essential math skills</li> 
<li>ability to interpret word problems</li> 
</ul>
so the right mitigation steps can be taken to ensure student success.<br/><br/>

<b>Then create ChemVantage assignments for your students</b><br/><br/>
With a few clicks in your LMS, you can assign students to watch instructional <b>videos</b> with embedded questions, 
take short <b>quizzes</b> on the reading assignment, use <b>in-class polls</b>, work <b>homework problems</b>, 
and complete <b>practice exams</b> to validate their learning. ChemVantage makes it easy.<br/><br/>

<br/><b>So what are you waiting for?</b><br/><br/>
When used in combination with an open source textbook, ChemVantage can help you make your General Chemistry class more affordable, more 
accessible, and help your students be more successful. Studies conducted at a large public research university showed that students who earned at least 
50% credit on ChemVantage assignments passed the course with a grade of C- or better 95% of the time. Wow.<br/><br/>
<div style='text-align: center;'><b>Can your current vendor do that?</b></div><br/>
