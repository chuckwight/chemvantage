An Open Education Resource for General Chemistry<br/><br/><br/>

<b>Let's face it. Chemistry is hard.</b><br/><br/>
But with commitment and lots of practice, almost anyone can master it. 
ChemVantage was founded in 2010 on the idea that the most effective learning takes place during repeated 
intermittent engagement with the subject material. By offering several kinds of online assignments, we challenge students to
<ul>
<li>prepare themselves in advance for class discussions</li>
<li>engage with in-class polls using their own phones or laptops (no clickers required)</li>
<li>apply their new knowledge to solving computer-graded homework problems and get immediate feedback</li>
<li>work in teams to promote collaborative learning and peer instruction</li>
</ul>
Many General Chemistry classes are so large that graded quizzes and homework assignments are impractical unless they are 
online and fully automated. You chose an Open Source textbook to help keep the cost of your course manageable. Why 
would you make students pay $100/semester or more to a commercial provider to grade homework assignments?

<br/><b>ChemVantage works with your learning management system using LTI</b><br/><br/>
You create ChemVantage assignments in your LMS, and the scores are posted automatically to the LMS grade book. 
No student personal identifiable information (PII) is stored on ChemVantage servers, so your data are always secure.<br/><br/>

<br/><b>Start with a placement exam</b><br/><br/>
Getting students into the right course at the right time is essential. The ChemVantage placement exam assesses
<ul>
<li>knowledge of basic chemistry</li>
<li>essential math skills</li> 
<li>ability to interpret word problems</li> 
</ul>
so the right mitigation steps can be taken to ensure student success.<br/><br/>

<b>Then create ChemVantage assignments for your students</b><br/><br/>
With a few clicks in your LMS, you can assign students to watch instructional <b>videos</b> with embedded questions, 
take short <b>quizzes</b> on the reading assignment, use <b>in-class polls</b>, work <b>homework problems</b>, 
and complete <b>practice exams</b> to validate their learning. ChemVantage makes it easy.<br/><br/>

<br/><b>ChemVantage is designed to be very low cost</b><br/><br/>
Our open source software is deployed on Google App Engine servers, which provide massive scaling at extremely low cost. The services 
are heavily text-based with no fancy widgets. We own all our content, so we don't pay royalties to publishers. For most 
students and institutions, ChemVantage is completely free.<br/><br/>

<br/><b>So what are you waiting for?</b><br/><br/>
When used in combination with an open source textbook, ChemVantage can help you make your General Chemistry class more affordable, more 
accessible, and help your students be more successful. Studies conducted at a large public research university showed that students who earned at least 
50% credit on ChemVantage assignments passed the course with a grade of C- or better 95% of the time. Wow.<br/><br/>
<div style='text-align: center;'><b>Can your current vendor do that?</b></div><br/>
ChemVantage has scored millions of quiz and homework questions for students since 2010. You owe it to yourself and your students to find out 
more about ChemVantage and the advantages of open source learning solutions.
