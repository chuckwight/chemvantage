<h2>Detailed Version:</h2>
ChemVantage is available as an installable Google App.  That means that users in your Google Apps domain will be able to navigate directly to ChemVantage and be seamlessly authenticated behind the scenes. ChemVantage is an Open Education Resource for teaching and learning college-level General Chemistry, so most client domains are likely to be
<ul>
<li>Colleges or universities using ChemVantage as a learning resource for General Chemistry classes.
<li>High schools using ChemVantage as a learning resource for advanced placement (AP) or concurrent enrollment chemistry classes.
</ul>


When you add a ChemVantage subscription to your installed apps by clicking the blue 'Add it now' button, you start a 4 month free trial period.  
During the free trial period, the number of ChemVantage users (students and instructors) in your domain is unlimited. 

<p>Users who navigate to ChemVantage in your domain are provisioned with a free basic account, which includes most features.  
Students who join ChemVantage groups must have <a href=/About#accounts>premium accounts</a>, which provide additional features associated with group functions.
During the free trial period, premium account upgrades are free and automatic when users join ChemVantage groups.

<p>At the end of the free trial period, all user accounts (basic and premium) will continue at no charge. 
New users who navigate to ChemVantage are automatically provisioned with a free basic account. 
However, in order to join a ChemVantage group, a new user must obtain a paid premium ChemVantage account in one of two ways (at the option of the domain administrator):
<ol>
<li>If the domain administrator has purchased premium account seats ($2.00 per seat in lots of 50 or more) then an available seat will be allocated to the student automatically when the student joins a group for the first time.
<li>If the administrator has not purchased seats, or if the seats have all been allocated, then the user will be assessed a one-time charge of $4.99 for the premium account upgrade before joining the group.
</ol>
Instructor accounts are always free.  
The instructor should first establish a free basic account by navigating to ChemVantage.  
At that point, the domain administrator can use the ChemVantage user management tools to find and identify her as an instructor, which includes a free premium account upgrade. 
Instructors can create ChemVantage groups for their own classes, establish assignment deadlines, select question items for assignments, view group assignment scores, manage group enrollments and configure the ChemVantage learner analytics tools.

<p>If you decide that ChemVantage is not a good fit for your institution, you can simply leave the app enabled and do nothing.  
There is no cost to the domain administrator except for any premium account seats that may have been purchased previously.  
Students will continue to be able to navigate to ChemVantage on their own, and they will continue to have the option of purchasing premium account upgrades themselves.
If you decide to unsubscribe from ChemVantage, all existing user accounts (basic and premium) will remain supported, but users will be placed in a more public area where they will see users and groups from other institutions.
The domain administrator will no longer see the user management tools, and those administrative functions will revert to the ChemVantage administrator.
