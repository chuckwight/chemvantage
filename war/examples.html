<br/><b>Students don't do optional</b><br/><br/>
It's true. Very few students will challenge themselves to complete homework assignments that are never graded. 
But most students will complete assignments if
<ul>
<li>the assignment counts for even a small portion of the course grade, and</li>
<li>the student gets immediate feedback on the assignment.</li>
</ul>
Immediate feedback helps them to correct mistakes and guides their learning. That's where ChemVantage fits in. Our 
assignments are designed to engage students for extended periods of time, allowing the correction of errors and 
repeated submissions to improve their score. ChemVantage assignments are designed to be learning tools, not assessment 
tools. So a good practice is to make each quiz or homework assignment worth no more than about 1% of the overall course grade.

<br/><b>Quizzes</b><br/><br/>
ChemVantage quizzes  are designed to encourage students to read and understand the textbook used for the course. The questions 
are based on material presented in most introductory General Chemistry textbooks.  Most question items have straighforward 
answers not requiring detailed calculations.  Questions are presented in several different formats including multiple choice, 
true/false, checkbox, fill-in-the-blank, and numeric answers.  Each quiz consists of 10 questions drawn at random from a 
database containing many more questions.  In the process of taking several quizzes to improve their scores, students will likely 
encounter some questions repeated from earlier quizzes; however, it is unlikely that any two quizzes will contain exactly the 
same set of questions in the same order.  By assigning quizzes to be completed prior to the lecture, instructors can be assured 
that students have some exposure to the material.  This allows for more discussion, dialog and engagement in the classroom, 
and it makes learning more fun (really!).<br/><br/>

<br/><b>Homework Problem Sets</b><br/><br/>
The homework assignments are designed to give students practice in solving quantitative problems having numeric answers. 
Each student can download the assignment, work the problems and submit the answers online. Answers are judged to be correct if the 
solution agrees with the solution found in the database to within a specified tolerance (indicated for each problem). 
For many problems, answers must be expressed with the appropriate number of significant figures. The site informs students which 
answers are correct, so that they can rework incorrectly solved problems and resubmit the answers. Each problem is based on randomly 
selected parameters, so the correct answer is different for each student. This makes them suitable for collaboration and working in 
teams, because even though the group may work to find a correct algorithm for solving a problem, each student will have to use the 
algorithm to find the detailed solution to his or her own problem.

<br/><b>Practice Exams</b><br/><br/>
Students can take timed practice exams that draw questions from any group of 3 or more topics.  Each exam is designed to take 60 minutes 
or less to complete, and includes a selection of 10 quiz questions worth 2 points each, 5 of the easier homework problems at 10 points each, 
and 2 more challenging homework problems worth 15 points each. The scores on each exam are disaggregated by topic to reveal the student's 
areas of strength and weakness.  Practice exams may be repeated as often as desired. Questions are drawn at random from the database, 
and the numeric questions are parameterized, making it extremely unlikely that a student will ever get two identical practice exams.<br/><br/>

<br/><b>So what are you waiting for?</b><br/><br/>
When used in combination with an open source textbook, ChemVantage can help you make your General Chemistry class more affordable, more 
accessible, and help your students be more successful. Studies conducted at a large public research university showed that students who earned at least 
50% credit on ChemVantage assignments passed the course with a grade of C- or better 95% of the time. Wow.<br/><br/>
<div style='text-align: center;'><b>Can your current vendor do that?</b></div><br/>
ChemVantage has scored millions of quiz and homework questions for students since 2010. You owe it to yourself and your students to find out 
more about ChemVantage and the advantages of open source learning solutions.
